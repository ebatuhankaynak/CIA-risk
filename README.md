# CIA-risk

For each project and their commits:  
`caller_callee_outputs/` contains call graphs.  
`devexp_outputs/` contains developer experience metrics.  
`raw/` contains commit metadata.  

Code:  
`example_*` files contain toy examples to use certain functions of our code.  
`fault_induce.txt` is the BIC dataset that we use.  
`main.py` runs the code on all features to replicate our results.  
`cumsum_pngs/` is the output cumulative risk assesment figures.  

Legacy:  
`jar_creation/`, `jar_files`, `callgraph`, `codeshovel` are legacy attempts at callgraph.  
`fonte_dataset.csv` is an old dataset that we stopped using due to lack of enough BIC labels.
